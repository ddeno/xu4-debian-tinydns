# Things to remember:

#   - Lines starting with `#' are comments, thus ignored.

# axfrdns allows zone transfer for any zone listed in the AXFR variable.
# It's a slash(/) separated list domain names. If not set, axfrdns allows zone
# transfer for all zones available in data.cdb

AXFR=

# Address of the remote host.

# TCPREMOTEIP=

# Remote TCP port.

# TCPREMOTEPORT=

# A non-root user whose privileges should be acquired by axfrdns.
# Default: daemon
# See: $ id -u daemon

# A non-root group whose privileges should be acquired by axfrdns.
# Default: daemon
# See: $ id -g daemon
#
GID=2

# ROOT: is the new root & working directory for axfrdns.
# Obviously, the user whose ID is mentioned above MUST be able to read from
# this directory.
#
# Also, this is where `data.cdb' file should reside.

# If HIDETTL is set, dnscache always uses a TTL of 0 in its responses.
#
# HIDETTL=

# If FORWARDONLY is set, dnscache treats the servers/roots as a list of IP
# addresses for other caches, not root servers. It forwards queries to those
# caches the same way a client does, rather than contacting a chain of servers
# according to NS records.

# FORWARDONLY=

# If DEBUG_LEVEL is set, axfrdns displays helpful debug messages to
# the console.
